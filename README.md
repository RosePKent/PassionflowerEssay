      Embedded in the very name of the passionflower is a suggestion of the exotic. Native to the Neotropics, the passionflower first entered Western cultural consciousness on its "discovery" in the forests of Brazil by Spanish colonists who saw in its strange morphology the symbol of the passion of Christ. As a Christian symbol, the passionflower proliferated in Renaissance Europe, and then became secularized in Victorian England, when it was absorbed by the cultural phenomenon of the "language of flowers" and the era’s over-the-top floral aesthetic. Cultivated varieties of the passionflower multiplied in Victorian hothouses that aimed to recreate the flowers’ tropical habitat in microcosm. Today there are over five hundred species of the genus Passiflora, and over four hundred hybrid forms that have been artificially produced under cultivation. Passionflowers represent the diversity and dynamism of the natural world, with curling and climbing tendrils, evanescent flowers, and shape-shifting leaves. Though named by Europeans for its symbolic representation of the Passion of Christ, the passionflower has also symbolized fervor and exoticism and has been cultivated worldwide for its medicinal properties and charismatic fruits.

### Indigenous Uses of the Passionflower

      From the Tupi people of Amazonia to the Algonquian of the Chesapeake region, Indigenous peoples harvested passionflowers as medicinal and culinary plants long before the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. Archaeological research suggests evidence of human consumption of Passiflora incarnata as early as the Late Archaic period (c.1000 BCE) in what is now the southeastern United States. [^1] The Cruz-Badiano Codex—a 1552 Aztec herbal—likely contains the oldest extant description of a passionflower: coanenepilli or "serpent’s tongue" in Nahuatl. [^2] Subsequent sixteenth-century ethnobotanical works recorded the Nahua people’s use of coanenepilli root as a diuretic and purgative. [^3]
