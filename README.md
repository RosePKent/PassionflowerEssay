### A Natural Wonder for the Global Church

With its new Christian symbolism, the American flower assimilated into the visual culture of early modern Europe. In a painting of the *Madonna and Child* (1530–35) by the Flemish artist Joos van Cleve, the infant Jesus scrambles away from two red flowers held in his mother’s hand: a carnation and a passionflower. The carnation, with its petals colored a deep blood-red and its stem and flower-head shaped like a nail, is symbolic of the crucifixion and passion of Christ. When compared to the carnation, the depiction of the passionflower is not naturalistic, but stylized and distinct. It is likely the passionflower depicted here was not painted from life but rather "from rumour."[^13] The flower bears a strong resemblance to the stylized form represented in the anonymous woodcut discussed previously, making it likely that it was copied from this, or another, early European representation of the flower. Yet, this painting is curious: it pre-dates by a few decades the proliferation of the flower—and any information or printed illustrations representing it—in Europe.[^14] Monardes’s description of the flower in 1574 and the later representations by the Jesuits in 1608 are the earliest accounts of the passionflower in Europe. Joos van Cleve would surely have never set eyes upon, or even heard about, the passionflower during his lifetime.[^15] How, then, did the passionflower appear in this painting?

It is likely that the passionflower was added to the painting by a different artist around a hundred years after Joos van Cleve completed it. Andy Haslit, curator at the Cincinnati Art Museum where the painting is held, described that a "black background was painted around the carnation, [and] the passionflower was painted right on top of the black." [^16] The painted passionflower grows out from the top of the carnation, as a sort of "updated" counterpart to the carnation, or a New World manifestation of Christ’s passion. It is impossible to know exactly why the passionflower was added to the painting, but in its layers of added paint, Christian narratives that were read into the natural world accumulate in the painting. The contrast between the naturalistic representation of the carnation, a native of the Mediterranean flora, and the stylized passionflower, native to South America, represents the symbolic potency of the passionflower before its mysterious and exoticized existence was supplanted by real flowers brought into European gardens.

### The Diversity of Passionflowers

Since Linnaeus’ classification, the known diversity of passionflowers has grown considerably: passionflowers encompass plant life forms that are visual, olfactory, dynamic, and malleable. The proliferation of the flower over evolutionary time represents the numerous and intimate entanglements of the plant with its predators, pollinators, and rainforest habitats. The flowers of *Passiflora mucronata*, for instance, are pollinated by bats and open at night in as little as fifteen seconds to release an odor that smells somewhat like pumpkin, fresh beans, or lemon cake.[^41] The common names of passionflowers indicate their diversity of forms: "moon-shaped-leaved" (*P. murucuza*), "bat-winged" (*P. vespertilio*), "cork-barked" (*P. suberosa*), "square-stalked" (*P. quadrangularis*), "laurel-leaved" (*P. laurifolia*), "apple-fruited" (*P. maliformis*), and even, "sea-anemone-like" (*P. actinia*).[^42]

In his painting, *Hummingbird and Passionflowers* (ca. 1875–1885), Martin Johnson Heade conveys a sense of the natural world as dynamic and evolving. The passionflowers (*Passiflora* *racemosa*) are depicted in close association with their tropical habitat and hummingbird pollinators. These striking red flowers, set against the backdrop of thunderous skies, infuse the tropical landscape with drama and allure. The entwining and climbing stems of the plant loop around the birds and the other arboreal branches of the rainforest canopy, bringing them gently into its tangle. The flowers’ curling tendrils are perplexing, quite literally: perplex, from the Latin *plexus*, means interwoven, entangled, involved, intricate, plaited.

Passionflower vines form a crucial part of the co-evolutionary enmeshments of the rainforest canopy. Many passionflowers are entangled in close relationships with longwing butterflies (heliconiids) whose caterpillars feed on their leaves. Zebra longwings have developed a resistance to chemicals in the plant’s leaves that discourages other insects from eating them. Not only are these butterflies able to eat passionflower leaves but they also internalize the poisons for their own ends, making themselves toxic to birds.

Yet passionflowers are not as immobile and defenseless as they might appear to human eyes and senses of time. The shapes of passionflower leaves, for instance, are some of the most malleable and diverse among plants: in some cases, their leaves can vary and mutate along a single vine, mimicking nonhost plants and discouraging butterflies from laying eggs on them.[^43] The deceit does not stop here: many passionflowers have structures on their leaves, such as little nubs or yellow spots, that mimic the appearance and arrangement of butterfly eggs and so deter longwings from laying eggs on leaves that appear to be occupied. Some even display structures that mimic the eggs of the longwing’s predators. In addition, nectar-producing glands on the leaves can be utilized to attract ants and wasps, which in turn attack the longwing caterpillars.[^44]

Bees have a far less complicated relationship with passionflowers. As Francis Channing Woodworth describes in her book *Wonders of the Insect World* (1853), "the nectar in the passion flower has an intoxicating effect" upon bees: "they now and then indulge in excessive drinking […] one may see half a dozen of these poor creatures lying on the ground, near the goblet which has so grossly intoxicated them, and entirely unable to stir an inch." [^45] This sprawling scene of inebriated bees places the passionflower not with notions of divine sacrifice and purity, but with indulgence, pleasure, and excess.

### Passionflowers Under Cultivation 

Passionflowers have seduced bees and gardeners alike: the vigorous climbers have been adopted into cultivation in European gardens as striking, curious, and strange representations of South America’s tropical forests. The allure of the passionflower to the gardener is represented in Asa B. Strong’s *American Flora* (1846–1850), where the plant is described as "the produce of South America and the West Indies, where the dense forests are filled with their numerous species, climbing over shrubs and trees, and bearing flowers of the most curious form of striking beauty."[^46] 
**INSERT **REPOSITORY IMAGE: "*The Blue Passion-flower *climbing a pillar, from Robert Thornton’s *Temple of Flora* (1799). Contrast this with Heade’s depictions of the flower. Here, the rainforest habitat is replaced by stone pillars in a distinctly European (garden) setting. The plants of the New World are moved into a Classical setting"
      

The artificial cultivation of these far-away rainforests, and the lush exoticism they came to represent, was often achieved under glass in hothouses, or stoves, and heated greenhouses. As one nineteenth-century periodical writes, passionflowers "attain greatest perfection planted out into good soil, in a hot-house, where its branches can be trained around a pillar, or under the roof, or over any trellis."[^47] In another publication, readers are encouraged to "allow the blooming shoots to hang about in festoons."[^48] The addition of tropical climbers to the hothouse made "the walls themselves constitute an extensive and eccentric garden."[^49] These jungles under glass were intended to recreate the heat and humidity of tropical forests in lavish microcosm.

Hothouses and stoves allowed for the artificial cultivation of passionflower hybrids: the first hybrid species, Passiflora x violacea, was produced in the United Kingdom in the 1820s by hand pollinating plants already in cultivation. As a nineteenth-century gardening publication described it, "most of the species [of passionflower] ripen fruit in our stoves, and consequently many fine varieties have been raised by impregnating the stigmas of one with the pollen of another…with a feather."[^50] The proliferation of these hybrid species, or "monsters under glass," reflect a horticultural mania intent on mixing the traits of different flowers to create copious varieties of color, size, and growth form.[^51] The hybrid Passiflora x belotii has been described as smelling like "refreshers" sweets.[^52] The "scarlet passionflower," described in one catalogue as "a blaze of fiery scarlet blossoms, which are set off in a never-to-be-forgotten way by the background of bright glossy green foliage," is as sickeningly elaborate as the advertiser’s prose used to describe it.[^53] On top of the five hundred or so "wild" species currently recognized, there are also over four hundred additional hybrid species.

In the multiplication of passionflower species under the heat of the hothouse, the distinctions between wild and hybrid species were not always clear, as an entry on *Passiflora amabilis* in the *Annals of Horticulture* (1849) illustrates: "whether it be a wild species introduced artificially within the culturist's domain, or has sprung up under cultivation—a garden hybrid, is, as far as we can learn, a matter of uncertainty."[^54] At the end of the eighteenth century, Mary Lawrance produced *A Collection of Passionflowers* (1799) consisting of 18 plates in which she aimed to "contain every species of Passion-flowers, now in cultivation in English Gardens."[^55] But by the mid-nineteenth century, the *Annals of Horticulture* reported that "it would be altogether outstepping our limits, to attempt to describe, or even to enumerate, all the kinds [of passionflowers] which exist in our gardens."[^56]

The hothouse is a steamy, pungent, intoxicating, but also sickly place: as the Italian poet Gariele D'Annunzio describes in erotic and corrupting terms, "…the over-bold/ Young vines in dense luxuriance rankly grow,/ And strange weird plants their horrid buds unfold…"[^57] The humidity, and the enumeration of such "strange weird plants" together under glass, creates a breeding ground for diseases such as rot. The term "hothouse flower," commonly used to refer to plants kept under glass that would only flower for a few days, developed a figurative meaning in the nineteenth century, to denote something or someone that is artificial, delicate, or fragile. [^58] Women, for instance, were described as hothouse flowers, as sorts of delicate beauties. At the same time, a "hothouse" came to be used as a colloquial term for a brothel—the domain, supposedly, of diseased, corrupted, and impregnated flowers (women).[^59]
