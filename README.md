### A Natural Wonder for the Global Church

With its new Christian symbolism, the American flower assimilated into the visual culture of early modern Europe. In a painting of the *Madonna and Child* (1530–35) by the Flemish artist Joos van Cleve, the infant Jesus scrambles away from two red flowers held in his mother’s hand: a carnation and a passionflower. The carnation, with its petals colored a deep blood-red and its stem and flower-head shaped like a nail, is symbolic of the crucifixion and passion of Christ. When compared to the carnation, the depiction of the passionflower is not naturalistic, but stylized and distinct. It is likely the passionflower depicted here was not painted from life but rather "from rumour."[^13] The flower bears a strong resemblance to the stylized form represented in the anonymous woodcut discussed previously, making it likely that it was copied from this, or another, early European representation of the flower. Yet, this painting is curious: it pre-dates by a few decades the proliferation of the flower—and any information or printed illustrations representing it—in Europe.[^14] Monardes’s description of the flower in 1574 and the later representations by the Jesuits in 1608 are the earliest accounts of the passionflower in Europe. Joos van Cleve would surely have never set eyes upon, or even heard about, the passionflower during his lifetime.[^15] How, then, did the passionflower appear in this painting?

It is likely that the passionflower was added to the painting by a different artist around a hundred years after Joos van Cleve completed it. Andy Haslit, curator at the Cincinnati Art Museum where the painting is held, described that a "black background was painted around the carnation, [and] the passionflower was painted right on top of the black." [^16] The painted passionflower grows out from the top of the carnation, as a sort of "updated" counterpart to the carnation, or a New World manifestation of Christ’s passion. It is impossible to know exactly why the passionflower was added to the painting, but in its layers of added paint, Christian narratives that were read into the natural world accumulate in the painting. The contrast between the naturalistic representation of the carnation, a native of the Mediterranean flora, and the stylized passionflower, native to South America, represents the symbolic potency of the passionflower before its mysterious and exoticized existence was supplanted by real flowers brought into European gardens.
